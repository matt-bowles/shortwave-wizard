# Shortwave Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *(June 2019 - present)

## About
Currently in development (albeit in a useable state), Shortwave Wizard aims to provide shortwave DXers with a convenient tool to find shortwave broadcasts to possibly receieve, as well as identify any unknown transmissions.

## Technology Stack
The following technologies are being used to develop the application:
- Laravel (purely as an API through Eloquent)
- React
- Material-UI
- MySQL

## Functionality
Users can:
- Browse and filter over 5000 known shortwave broadcasts via station/broadcaster, language, frequency, and whether or not a broadcast is currently live
- Identify an unknown broadcast via frequency
- Obtain a broadcast's estimated coverage area and whether or not the user is likely to hear it
- Maintain a virtual listening log of stations that they have heard, including basic SINPO logging **(PLANNED)**
- Be provided with a link to a WebSDR receiver that is most likely able to receieve the transmission **(PLANNED)**
